     <p>If weekends leave you feeling overwhelmed, behind, or unsure where to start, you’re not alone. For ADHD brains, two days “off” don’t always mean rest. Sometimes they turn into a blur of intentions, unfinished chores, and guilt about everything you didn’t get done.</p>

    <p>But here’s the truth: <strong>You don’t need to catch up. You don’t need to finish everything. You just need to breathe — and reset gently.</strong></p>

    <p>This soft ADHD Weekend Reset is designed for <strong>low-energy days</strong>, <strong>executive dysfunction</strong>, and anyone craving a calmer start to the week. It’s simple, flexible, and completely shame-free.</p>

    <p>Let’s make Monday feel kinder — one tiny step at a time. 🌿</p>

    <h2>1. Pick One Thing Only</h2>
    <p>Not the whole list. Not everything you’ve been avoiding. Just <strong>one</strong> small task that makes Monday feel lighter.</p>

    <p>Some ideas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear one surface</li>
      <li>Start a load of laundry</li>
      <li>Take trash out or put it by the door</li>
      <li>Reset your entryway</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t about productivity — it’s about removing friction.</p>

    <p><strong>ADHD Tip:</strong> When you limit yourself to one thing, your brain stops resisting. You may even naturally do more (and if you don’t? Still a win).</p>

    <h2>2. Reset Your Space (5–10 Minutes)</h2>
    <p>Your home doesn’t need a deep clean. It just needs to breathe.</p>

    <p>Try a micro-reset:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make your bed</li>
      <li>Gather dishes into the sink</li>
      <li>Throw away the obvious trash</li>
      <li>Open blinds or crack a window</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A tiny environmental shift can create a huge mental shift — especially for ADHD brains that feel clutter visually and emotionally.</p>

    <h2>3. Reset Your Brain</h2>
    <p>Weekends get messy inside your head too — tasks, thoughts, little worries, random ideas.</p>

    <p>A gentle brain reset can look like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewing next week’s calendar</li>
      <li>Planning just 2–3 meals</li>
      <li>Doing a 2-minute brain dump</li>
      <li>Highlighting only what’s truly important</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t “planning your life.” It’s just clearing mental static so your brain can exhale.</p>

    <h2>4. Reset Your Body</h2>
    <p>A regulated nervous system supports everything else. Treat your body like it deserves softness.</p>

    <p>Try one or two:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A long shower</li>
      <li>Lotion + comfy clothes</li>
      <li>Hydrate</li>
      <li>Step outside for 2 minutes</li>
      <li>Stretch slowly</li>
      <li>Put on fresh bedding</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn’t self-care aesthetic — it’s nervous-system care.</p>

    <h2>5. Reset Your Joy</h2>
    <p>Your weekend reset doesn’t end with chores. It ends with something that fills you.</p>

    <p>Choose anything that feels warm or grounding:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tea, knitting, journaling, or drawing</li>
      <li>A show you genuinely love (not just background noise)</li>
      <li>A slow sniff-walk with your dog</li>
      <li>Listening to music you loved in middle school</li>
      <li>Curling up under a blanket</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal is to make Sunday feel like comfort, not pressure.</p>

    <h2>Low-Energy Version</h2>
    <p>If you’re tired, overwhelmed, or frozen in place, do <strong>half of a step.</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fold 2 pieces of laundry</li>
      <li>Bring one cup to the sink</li>
      <li>Make part of the bed</li>
      <li>Do a 60-second brain dump</li>
      <li>Drink a few sips of water</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Half a step still counts. Half a step still helps. Half a step is still progress.</p>

    <h2>A Kinder Start to Your Week</h2>
    <p>This routine isn’t about productivity — it’s about peace. It’s about shrinking the Sunday Scaries, lowering the pressure, and giving your ADHD brain exactly what it needs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clarity</li>
      <li>Comfort</li>
      <li>Structure</li>
      <li>Softness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don’t have to earn rest. You don’t have to complete everything. You just have to show up gently for yourself.</p>

    <p>And that’s enough. Always. 🌿</p>
